h1. Scout Scout

A library for extracting data out of "Scout Monitoring (scoutapp.com)":http//scoutapp.com, a hosted monitoring service. This is experimental and likely to change. Consult your doctor before beginning a scouting program.

h2. Example Usage

<pre><code>
    require 'scout_scout'
    scout = ScoutScout.new('youraccountname', 'your@awesome.com', 'sekret')
    
    #all your servers
    clients = scout.clients
    
    #one specific server - pass in hostname
    ram_hungry = ScoutScout::Client.first('db1.awesome.com')
    
    #all servers that match the hostname.
    # see mysql regex formatting: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/regexp.html
    app_servers = ScoutScout::Client.all('db[0-9]*.awesome.com')
    
    #details on that server's plugins
    ram_hungry_plugins = ram_hungry.plugins
    
    #details about a specific plugin
    data = ram_hungry.plugin(12345)
    
    #all available descriptors
    descriptors = ScoutScout::Descriptor.all
    
    #cluster metrics
    ScoutScout::Cluster.average('mem_used')
</code></pre>

h2. Metrics

The library allows you to extract aggregate metrics across all and/or selected servers in your account. @See Cluster#average@
for information and examples.
    
h2. Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
